            <p> James Slone is a tech enthusiast with a passion for computer technology and design. He is currently enrolled
                in the Interactive media design program and has already gained two years of experience working as a
                freelance video editor with software programs such as Photoshop, Davinci Resolve, and Blender. James is an
                eager learner who is excited to add to his skillset with his first foray into HTML. He brings a creative eye
                to his work and enjoys experimenting with different design techniques. When not exploring the digital world,
                James can be found appreciating the wonders of nature, including his favorite molecule, H2O.
